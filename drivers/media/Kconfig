config MEDIA_CONTROLLER
	bool "Media Controller API (EXPERIMENTAL)"

	  Enable the media controller API used to query media devices internal
	  topology and configure it dynamically.

	  This API is mostly used by camera interfaces in embedded platforms.

config VIDEO_DEV
	tristate "Video For Linux"
	---help---
	  V4L core support for video capture and overlay devices, webcams and
	  AM/FM radio cards.

	  This kernel includes support for the new Video for Linux Two API,
	  (V4L2).

	  Additional info and docs are available on the web at
	  <http://linuxtv.org>

	  Documentation for V4L2 is also available on the web at
	  <http://bytesex.org/v4l/>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called videodev.

config VIDEO_V4L2_SUBDEV_API
	bool "V4L2 sub-device userspace API (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on VIDEO_DEV && MEDIA_CONTROLLER && EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  Enables the V4L2 sub-device pad-level userspace API used to configure
	  video format, size and frame rate between hardware blocks.

	  This API is mostly used by camera interfaces in embedded platforms.

	  DVB core utility functions for device handling, software fallbacks etc.

	  Enable this if you own a DVB/ATSC adapter and want to use it or if
	  you compile Linux for a digital SetTopBox.

	  Say Y when you have a DVB or an ATSC card and want to use it.

	  API specs and user tools are available from <http://www.linuxtv.org/>.

	  Please report problems regarding this support to the LinuxDVB
	  mailing list.

	  If unsure say N.

	help
	  This option enables DVB Network Support which is a part of the DVB
	  standard. It is used, for example, by automatic firmware updates used
	  on Set-Top-Boxes. It can also be used to access the Internet via the
	  DVB card, if the network provider supports it.

	  You may want to disable the network support on embedded devices. If
	  unsure say Y.

config MEDIA_SUBDRV_AUTOSELECT

	depends on MEDIA_TUNER
	default y
	help
	  By default, a TV driver auto-selects all possible tuners
	  thar could be used by the driver.

	  This is generally the right thing to do, except when there
	  are strict constraints with regards to the kernel size.

	  Use this option with care, as deselecting tuner drivers which
	  are in fact necessary will result in TV devices which cannot
	  be tuned due to lack of the tuning driver.

	  If unsure say Y.
