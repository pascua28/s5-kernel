config VIDEO_DEV

	  V4L core support for video capture and overlay devices, webcams and
	  AM/FM radio cards.

	  This kernel includes support for the new Video for Linux Two API,
	  (V4L2).

	  Additional info and docs are available on the web at
	  <http://linuxtv.org>

	  Documentation for V4L2 is also available on the web at
	  <http://bytesex.org/v4l/>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called videodev.

	  Enables the V4L2 sub-device pad-level userspace API used to configure
	  video format, size and frame rate between hardware blocks.

	  This API is mostly used by camera interfaces in embedded platforms.

	  DVB core utility functions for device handling, software fallbacks etc.

	  Enable this if you own a DVB/ATSC adapter and want to use it or if
	  you compile Linux for a digital SetTopBox.

	  Say Y when you have a DVB or an ATSC card and want to use it.

	  API specs and user tools are available from <http://www.linuxtv.org/>.

	  Please report problems regarding this support to the LinuxDVB
	  mailing list.

	  If unsure say N.

	help
	  This option enables DVB Network Support which is a part of the DVB
	  standard. It is used, for example, by automatic firmware updates used
	  on Set-Top-Boxes. It can also be used to access the Internet via the
	  DVB card, if the network provider supports it.

	  You may want to disable the network support on embedded devices. If
	  unsure say Y.

	default y
	help
	  By default, a media driver auto-selects all possible ancillary
	  devices such as tuners, sensors, video encoders/decoders and
	  frontends, that are used by any of the supported devices.

	  This is generally the right thing to do, except when there
	  are strict constraints with regards to the kernel size.

	  Use this option with care, as deselecting ancillary drivers which
	  are, in fact, necessary will result in the lack of the needed
	  functionality for your device (it may not tune or may not have
	  the needed demodulators).

	  If unsure say Y.
