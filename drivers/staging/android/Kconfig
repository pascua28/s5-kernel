config ANDROID
	bool "Android Drivers"
	default N
	---help---
	  Enable support for various drivers needed on the Android platform

if ANDROID

config ANDROID_BINDER_IPC
	bool "Android Binder IPC Driver"
	default n
	---help---
	  Binder is used in Android for both communication between processes,
	  and remote method invocation.

	  This means one Android process can call a method/routine in another
	  Android process, using Binder to identify, invoke and pass arguments
	  between said processes.

config ANDROID_BINDER_IPC_32BIT
	bool "Use old 32-bit binder api"
	depends on !64BIT
	---help---
	  Enable to support an old 32-bit Android user-space. Breaks the new
	  Android user-space.

config ANDROID_BINDER_DEVICES
	string "Android Binder devices"
	depends on ANDROID_BINDER_IPC
	default "binder,hwbinder,vndbinder"
	---help---
	  Default value for the binder.devices parameter.

	  The binder.devices parameter is a comma-separated list of strings
	  that specifies the names of the binder device nodes that will be
	  created. Each binder device has its own context manager, and is
	  therefore logically separated from the other devices.

config ASHMEM
	bool "Enable the Anonymous Shared Memory Subsystem"
	default n
	depends on SHMEM
	---help---
	  The ashmem subsystem is a new shared memory allocator, similar to
	  POSIX SHM but with different behavior and sporting a simpler
	  file-based API.

	  It is, in theory, a good memory allocator for low-memory devices,
	  because it can discard shared memory units when under memory pressure.

config ANDROID_LOGGER
	tristate "Android log driver"
	default n
	---help---
	  This adds support for system-wide logging using four log buffers.

	  These are:

	      1: main
	      2: events
	      3: radio
	      4: system

	  Log reading and writing is performed via normal Linux reads and
	  optimized writes. This optimization avoids logging having too
	  much overhead in the system.

config LOGCAT_SIZE
	int "Adjust android log buffer sizes"
	default 512
	depends on ANDROID_LOGGER
	help
	  Set logger buffer size. Enter a number greater than zero.
	  Any value less than 256 is recommended. Reduce value to save kernel static memory size.

config ANDROID_PERSISTENT_RAM
	bool
	depends on HAVE_MEMBLOCK
	select REED_SOLOMON
	select REED_SOLOMON_ENC8
	select REED_SOLOMON_DEC8

config ANDROID_RAM_CONSOLE
	bool "Android RAM buffer console"
	depends on !S390 && !UML && HAVE_MEMBLOCK
	select ANDROID_PERSISTENT_RAM
	default n

config PERSISTENT_TRACER
	bool "Persistent function tracer"
	depends on HAVE_FUNCTION_TRACER
	select FUNCTION_TRACER
	select ANDROID_PERSISTENT_RAM
	help
	  persistent_trace traces function calls into a persistent ram
	  buffer that can be decoded and dumped after reboot through
	  /sys/kernel/debug/persistent_trace.  It can be used to
	  determine what function was last called before a reset or
	  panic.

	  If unsure, say N.

config ANDROID_TIMED_OUTPUT
	bool "Timed output class driver"
	default y

config ANDROID_TIMED_GPIO
	tristate "Android timed gpio driver"
	depends on GPIOLIB && ANDROID_TIMED_OUTPUT
	default n

config ANDROID_LOW_MEMORY_KILLER
	bool "Android Low Memory Killer"
	default N
	---help---
	  Registers processes to be killed when memory is low

config ANDROID_LOW_MEMORY_KILLER_AUTODETECT_OOM_ADJ_VALUES
	bool "Android Low Memory Killer: detect oom_adj values"
	depends on ANDROID_LOW_MEMORY_KILLER
	default y
	---help---
	  Detect oom_adj values written to
	  /sys/module/lowmemorykiller/parameters/adj and convert them
	  to oom_score_adj values.

config SEC_OOM_KILLER
	bool "Android OOM Killer"
	default n
	help
	  klaatu@samsung
	  This enables 'Android-Style oom-killer'
	  The way to select victim by oom-killer provided by
	  linux kernel is totally different from android policy.
	  Hence, it makes more sense that we select the oom victim
	  as android does when LMK is invoked.

config SEC_DEBUG_LMK_MEMINFO
	bool "Show Meminfo when lmk invoked"
	depends on !SAMSUNG_PRODUCT_SHIP
	default n
	help
	  Show memory information when lmk kills process

config SEC_DEBUG_LMK_COUNT_INFO
	bool "Record LMK execution count"
	default n
	help
	  Show LMK execution count information when lmk invoked

config EXCLUDE_LRU_LIVING_IN_CMA
	bool "Exclude LRU living is CMA"
	depends on CMA_PAGE_COUNTING
	default n
	help
	  Number of LRU pages living in CMA area should be excluded
          so that LMK will kill a process to release memory pressure
	  This feature based on reclamation prohibition for CMA area.

config RUNTIME_COMPCACHE
	bool "Android rtcc v3"
	depends on ZRAM && ANDROID

	help
	  This option enables rtcc v3 for android

config KSWAPD_NOSWAP

config ANDROID_INTF_ALARM_DEV
	bool "Android alarm driver"
	depends on RTC_CLASS
	default n
	---help---
	  Provides non-wakeup and rtc backed wakeup alarms based on rtc or
	  elapsed realtime, and a non-wakeup alarm on the monotonic clock.
	  Also exports the alarm interface to user-space.

config SYNC
	bool "Synchronization framework"
	default n
	select ANON_INODES
	help
	  This option enables the framework for synchronization between multiple
	  drivers.  Sync implementations can take advantage of hardware
	  synchronization built into devices like GPUs.

config SW_SYNC
	bool "Software synchronization objects"
	default n
	depends on SYNC
	help
	  A sync object driver that uses a 32bit counter to coordinate
	  syncrhronization.  Useful when there is no hardware primitive backing
	  the synchronization.

config SW_SYNC_USER
	bool "Userspace API for SW_SYNC"
	default n
	depends on SW_SYNC
	help
	  Provides a user space API to the sw sync object.
	  *WARNING* improper use of this can result in deadlocking kernel
	  drivers from userspace.
